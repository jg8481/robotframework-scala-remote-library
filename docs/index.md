## Useful Features And Capabilities

The following are useful features, experiments, and capabilities provided by this remote library example.
- Resusable remote library implementation found in `ScalaRemoteLibraryServer.scala`
- Docker and docker-compose capability
- Working Scala Native code example and experiments
- Working Ammonite examples and experiments
- Working ScalaCheck examples and experiments

## Future Plans

In addition to improving the exisiting features, I plan on working on the following.
- Experiments with Gatling.io
- Experiments with Javascript interop
- Experiments with the Robotframework's RPA capabilities
