# Docker Robot Framework Scala

This Docker container will build a simple Scala Native application that will take text from the command line and pipe it into a text file. It also uses the same `scala-remote-library-server-1.0.jar` and Scala keywords code that is used in the desktop version of these Robot Framework Scala tests.
